It is twice blest: <br>It blesseth him that gives and him that takes. <br>'T is mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes <br>The throned monarch better than his crown; <br>His sceptre shows the force of temporal power, <br>The attribute to awe and majesty, <br>Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings; <br>But mercy is above this sceptred sway, <br>It is enthroned in the hearts of kings, <br>It is an attribute to God himself; <br>And earthly power doth then show likest God's, <br>When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew, <br>Though justice be thy plea, consider this, <br>That in the course of justice none of us <br>Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy; <br>And that same prayer doth teach us all to render <br>The deeds of mercy.","author":"William Shakespeare"}]}
