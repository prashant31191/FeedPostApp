Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan 'Press On' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.","author":"Calvin Coolidge"},{"quote":"You must keep sending work out; you must never let a manuscript do nothing but eat its head off in a drawer. You send that work out again and again, while you're working on another one.
