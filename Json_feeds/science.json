{"topic":"science","quotes":[{"quote":"Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.","author":"Albert Einstein"},{"quote":"When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.","author":"Arthur C. Clarke"},{"quote":"Science has proof without any certainty. Creationists have certainty without any proof.","author":"Ashley Montague"},{"quote":"Science may set limits to knowledge, but should not set limits to imagination.","author":"Bertrand Russell"},{"quote":"I maintain there is much more wonder in science than in pseudoscience. And in addition, to whatever measure this term has any meaning, science has the additional virtue, and it is not an inconsiderable one, of being true.","author":"Carl Sagan"},{"quote":"All science is either physics or stamp collecting.","author":"Ernest Rutherford"},{"quote":"Science is nothing but developed perception, interpreted intent, common sense rounded out and minutely articulated.","author":"George Santayana"},{"quote":"Nothing shocks me. I'm a scientist.","author":"Harrison Ford"},{"quote":"Science is facts; just as houses are made of stones, so is science made of facts; but a pile of stones is not a house and a collection of facts is not necessarily science.","author":"Henri Poincare"},{"quote":"There are in fact two things, science and opinion; the former begets knowledge, the latter ignorance.","author":"Hippocrates"},{"quote":"Science is organized knowledge. Wisdom is organized life.","author":"Immanuel Kant"},{"quote":"The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds new discoveries, is not 'Eureka!' (I found it!) but 'That's funny ...'","author":"Isaac Asimov"},{"quote":"Perfect as the wing of a bird may be, it will never enable the bird to fly if unsupported by the air. Facts are the air of science. Without them a man of science can never rise.","author":"Ivan Pavlov"},{"quote":"It is a good morning exercise for a research scientist to discard a pet hypothesis every day before breakfast. It keeps him young.","author":"Konrad Lorenz"},{"quote":"The cloning of humans is on most of the lists of things to worry about from Science, along with behaviour control, genetic engineering, transplanted heads, computer poetry and the unrestrained growth of plastic flowers.","author":"Lewis Thomas"},{"quote":"There are no such things as applied sciences, only applications of science.","author":"Louis Pasteur"},{"quote":"As an adolescent I aspired to lasting fame, I craved factual certainty, and I thirsted for a meaningful vision of human life - so I became a scientist. This is like becoming an archbishop so you can meet girls.","author":"M. Cartmill"},{"quote":"I am among those who think that science has great beauty. A scientist in his laboratory is not only a technician: he is also a child placed before natural phenomena which impress him like a fairy tale.","author":"Marie Curie"},{"quote":"We must not forget that when radium was discovered no one knew that it would prove useful in hospitals. The work was one of pure science. And this is a proof that scientific work must not be considered from the point of view of the direct usefulness of it. It must be done for itself, for the beauty of science, and then there is always the chance that a scientific discovery may become like the radium a benefit for humanity.","author":"Marie Curie"},{"quote":"There is something fascinating about science. One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact.","author":"Mark Twain"},{"quote":"Our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power. We have guided missiles and misguided men.","author":"Martin Luther King Jr."},{"quote":"A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar withï¿½it.","author":"Noam Chomsky"},{"quote":"As soon as questions of will or decision or reason or choice of action arise, human science is at a loss.","author":"Paul Dirac"},{"quote":"In science one tries to tell people, in such a way as to be understood by everyone, something that no one ever knew before. But in poetry, it's the exact opposite.","author":"Richard Feynman"},{"quote":"I believe that a scientist looking at nonscientific problems is just as dumb as the next guy.","author":"Richard Feynman"},{"quote":"Philosophers say a great deal about what is absolutely necessary for science, and it is always, so far as one can see, rather naive, and probably wrong.","author":"Sir Arthur Eddington"},{"quote":"Science is one thing, wisdom is another. Science is an edged tool, with which men play like children, and cut their own fingers.","author":"Sir Francis Darwin"},{"quote":"In science the credit goes to the man who convinces the world, not the man to whom the idea first occurs.","author":"Sir William Bragg"},{"quote":"The important thing in science is not so much to obtain new facts as to discover new ways of thinking about them.","author":"Stephen Jay Gould"},{"quote":"In science, 'fact' can only mean 'confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent.' I suppose that apples might start to rise tomorrow, but the possibility does not merit equal time in physics classrooms."}]}
